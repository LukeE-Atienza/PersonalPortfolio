<h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
    <p>Dreamwork's latest animated film, and quite possibly one of their best so far. Featuring amazing visuals, moving soundtrack, and an dynamically emotive storyline, this is a film sure to make you have a good cry. The film explores themes such as parenthood, coming of age, identity, and more.</p>
<h3>How to Train Your Dragon</h3>
    <p>Another Dreamworks classic, and honestly self-explanatory. Like the Wild Robot, this film shines on themes such as parenthood, coming of age, purpose, and, most importantly, awesome dragons and vikings. </p>
<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
    <p>Shoya Ishida is a reformed bully seeking redemption by trying to make friends with the deaf girl he used to bully, Shouko Nishimiya. This masterpiece by Yoshitoki Oima touches on topics such as anxiety, isolation, suicide, and more in a beautiful picture showing that redemption is truly possible. </p>
